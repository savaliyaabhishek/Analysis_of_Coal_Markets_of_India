\section{Introduction}
Coal in India has been mined since 1774, and India is the second largest producer and consumer of coal after China, mining 777.31 million metric tons (856.84 million short tons) in FY 2022. Dhanbad, the largest coal producing city, has been called the coal capital of India.
\par
Most of the coal is burned to generate electricity and most electricity is generated by coal, but coal-fired power plants have been criticised for breaking environmental laws.The health and environmental impact of the coal industry is serious, and phasing out coal would have short-term health and environmental benefits greatly exceeding the costs. Electricity from new solar farms in India is cheaper than that generated by the country's existing coal plants.

\par Coal provides about half of India’s commercial primary energy supply today and is the dominant fuel for power production in India. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi established ambitious goals for renewable energy (RE) development, aiming to quadruple its capacity by 2022. Despite expected growth in RE, we project that coal will remain the dominant fuel for electricity generation in India through 2030 and beyond, even though its share of generation will fall. 
\par
Coal India Limited (CIL) is the world’s largest coal mining company and produces 84 percent of India’s thermal coal. Most coal is sold to power producers, predominantly under fuel supply agreements, at administered prices. But, for years, CIL has not kept up with growing demand. The Indian government now allows end-users to produce their own coal and is moving toward allowing more private-sector mining. India also imports coal, which is particularly used in coastal areas far from the coal mines of India’s east.
\par
The coal industry is knit into the fabric of the Indian economy. The central government owns a little over 75 percent of CIL, which provides significant revenue to the national treasury through dividend payments. CIL is also a major employer, and, in many parts of India, the largest one. Levies on coal are an important source of revenue for the central government and especially for coal-producing states, among the poorest in the nation. Finally, Indian Railways’ freight charges for coal subsidize passenger transport, and coal provides 44 percent of freight revenues, despite being only 40 percent of total freight tonne-kilometers. For power plants located far from mines, transport can be the largest component of the delivered coal price.
\par
We have analysed the following datasets released by the official NDAP website of the Government of India.
\begin{itemize}
\item Coal Consumption
\item Coal Reserves Production by State
\item Coal Supply Production by State
\item Potential, Generation, Capacity - Renewable
\item Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal - Production of coal and its value by state and sector
\item Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal - Production of coal and lignite over the last 5 years
\item Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- No. of Mines by Type
\item Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- Statewise production of raw coal and lignite for the last 5 years
\item Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- Statewise/Fieldwise Inventory of Geographical Reserve of Coal
\end{itemize}

\section{Coal Consumption in India}
\par
India is one of the largest consumers of coal in the world. The country consumed 906.08 million metric tons (0.99878 billion short tons) of coal in 2020–21, of which 79.03\% was produced domestically.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{coal consumption yearly.png}}
\caption{Coal consumption of India in last decade}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
\par
Coal consumption grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.96\% over the previous decade. This growth is due to the large population rise in India in the last decade.

\subsection{Statewise consumption of coal}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coal consumed.png}}
\caption{Coal consumption across various states}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

The top 5 coal-consuming states in India are Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra respectively. Central Indian states have been the largest consumers of coal in the past decade because of the ease of availability of coal over other resources to generate electricity and the presence of large steel industries there. 

\subsection{Coal consuming sectors of India}

The electricity sector is the largest consumer of raw coal in India and accounted for 64.07\% of the total coal consumed in the country in 2020-21. Other significant consumers include the steel and washery industry (6.65\%), the sponge iron industry (1.06\%), the cement industry (0.75\%), and fertilizers and chemicals (0.19\%).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{coal consuming sectors.png}}
\caption{Coal consuming sectors}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
\par
Coal generated over 73\% of electricity produced in 2020–21.  On average, the Indian power plants using India's coal supply consume about 0.7 kg of coal to generate a kWh, whereas United States thermal power plants consume about 0.45 kg of coal per kWh. This is because of the difference in the quality of the coal, as measured by the Gross Calorific Value (GCV). 
\subsection{Consumption of different types of Coal}
Raw Coal contributes to almost 90\% consumption of coal in India followed by Lignite, Washed coal, and Middlings.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{type of coal consumed.png}}
\caption{Different types of coal consumption}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\section{Coal Reserves of India}
India has the fourth largest coal reserves in the world. As of 1 April 2021, India had 352.13 billion metric tons (388.16 billion short tons) of the resource.
\subsection{Different Categories of Coal Reserves}
\par
The Coal resources of India are available in older Gondwana Formations of peninsular India and north-eastern region. Based on the results of Regional exploration, where the boreholes are normally placed 1-2 Km apart, the resources are classified into ‘Indicated’ or ‘Inferred’ category. Subsequent Detailed Exploration in selected blocks, where boreholes are less than 400 meter apart, upgrades the resources into more reliable ‘Proved/Measured’ category.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Type of reserve.png}}
\caption{Types of Coal Reserves}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statewise Coal Reserves}
\par
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{statewise reserve.png}}
\caption{Coal reserves across various states}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
Coal deposits are primarily found in eastern and south-central India. Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh accounted for almost 70\% of the total known coal reserves in India.
\par
There are considerable amount of reserves in north-east India, too. Coal is mined in these states but still they don't even have proper electricity supply as the coal mined here have been either sold to private companies or send out to other states and metropolitan regions by the government. 

\subsection{Reserves by type of Coal}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Reserves by type of coal.png}}
\caption{Amount of reserves for different type of Coal}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par 
Most of the Coal present in Indian reserves is of Non-Coking type. Which is mainly used as thermal coal for power generation. It is a low quality coal hence India depends on imports for high quality coal used in other industries.
\par
 India imported 215.25 million metric tons (237.27 million short tons) and exported 2.95 million metric tons (3.25 million short tons) of coal in 2020-21. Net imports of coal declined by 13.39\% over the previous fiscal. India's net imports of coal grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.62\% over the last 10 years. India is the second largest coal importer in the world, after China.

\subsection{Top 5 Coal fields in India}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item TALCHER, Odisha
    \item MAND-RAIGARH, Chhattisgarh
    \item RANIGANJ, West Bengal
    \item IB-RIVER, Odisha

\end{figure}

\section{Coal Supply Production in India}

\par India is the second largest producer of coal in the world, after China. The production of coal was 716.08 million metric tons (789.34 million short tons) in 2020–21, a decline of 2.02\% over the previous year primarily due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Coal Supply.png}}
\caption{Total Coal Supply in India in last decade}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statewise Coal Supply}
\par
Top coal supplying Indian states are Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and odisha. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{statewise supply.png}}
\caption{Coal supplied by different Indian states}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ Coal Supplying Sectors of India}

CIL  (Coal India Limited) is the largest public sector coal supplying organization in India. It was formed during nationalisation of coal mines in 1973. In February 2018, the government permitted private firms to enter the commercial coal mining industry and now Indian coal markets are slowly moving towards privatization.
\par
All India production of coal was at 716.08 million tonnes in 2020-21. While Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries accounted for 596.221 million tonnes during 2020-21.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coal supply sector.png}}
\caption{Sectorwise Coal supply}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Supply of different types of coal}
\par
As India's Coal reserves majorly contains non-coking coal, this type of coal contributes most in supply of coal. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{type of coal supply.png}}
\caption{Different type of Coal's supply}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par
India targets to increase its coal production to 1,200 million metric tons (1,300 million short tons) by 2023-24.

\section{Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal - Production of coal and its value by state and sector}

\subsection{Non-Captive Coal Mines }
\par
Non-captive Mines are mines from which the produced coals of minerals could be used for its own consumption and as well as for selling it.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{top 10 non-captive.png}}
\caption{Quantity Of Coal Produced By Non Captive Public Mines By States}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par
All non-captive private mines of India are situated in the state Jharkhand. They have produced 6.2 million tonnes of coal in last 5 years.

\subsection{Captive Coal Mines }
Captive mines are the mines that are owned by companies. The coal or mineral produced from these mines is for the exclusive use of the owner company of the mines. The company cannot sell coal or mineral outside. Some electricity generation companies used to have captive mines.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{top 5 captive public.png}}

\section{Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- Statewise/Fieldwise Inventory of Geographical Reserve of Coal}

\subsection{Inferred Resources }
Inferred Mineral Resource is the part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade (or quality) and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be of limited or uncertain quality and it is also reliability.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{inferred.png}}
\caption{Quantity Of Coal Produced From Inferred Sources By States}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Indicated Resources }
Indicated resources are simply economic mineral occurrences that have been sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and drill holes) to a point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of their contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Quantity Of Coal Produced From Indicated Sources By States}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proved Resources}
Proven reserves (also called measured reserves, 1P, and reserves) is a measure of fossil fuel energy reserves, such as oil reserves, natural gas reserves, and coal reserves.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{proved.png}}
\caption{Quantity Of Coal Produced From Proved Sources By States}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\section{Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal - Production of coal and lignite over the last 5 years}
\subsection{Non-coking coal}
Non Coking Coal does not have any caking properties and it is mainly used as thermal coal for power generation. It has a higher ash content and also used in industries like cement, fertilizer, glass, ceramic, paper, chemical and brick manufacturing.

\subsection{coking coal}
Coking coal or Metallurgical coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke. It is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking.

\subsection{Lignite}
Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat. It has a carbon content around 25–35\%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.

\label{fig}
\end{figure}



\section{Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- No. of Mines by Type}
\subsection{Open-Cast Mines}
 Open cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.39]{opencastmines.png}}
\caption{Open-Cast Mines across various states}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Underground Mines}
An underground coal mine is a mine at which coal is produced by tunneling into the earth to the coalbed, which is then mined with underground mining equipment  and transported to the surface.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.39]{Underground Mines.png}}
\caption{Underground Mines across various states}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mixed Mines}
Mixed mines are the combination of both Open cast and underground Mines.

\section{Statewise Inventory of Geological Resources of Coal- Statewise production of raw coal and lignite for the last 5 years}
\subsection{Value of coal}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{statewise coal last 5 year.png}}
\caption{Value of coal produced by top 10 states in last 5 years}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par
India has produced 5.27 trillion INR worth of coal in last 5 years. Jharkhand alone contributed 1.185 trillion INR followed by Madhya Pradesh (835 billion INR) and Telangana (678 billion INR).


\subsection{Quantity of coal}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{statewise coal quant 5 yr.png}}
\caption{Quantity of coal produced by top 10 states in last 5 years}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par
India has produced 3.65 billion tonnes of coal in last 5 years. Major contributor states are Chhattisgarh(731 million tonnes) followed by odisha(708 million tonnes) and Jharkhand (637 million tonnes).

\subsection{Statewise Lignite reserves}
Tamil Nadu holds largest reserves of Lignite in India ( 36.5 billion tonnes ) followed by Rajasthan ( 6.3 billion tonnes ) and Gujarat (2.7 billion tonnes).
While other states hold negligible amount of lignite reserves.
\newpage
\section{Renewable energy: A step towards future and its impacts on coal markets}

In 2020 think tank Carbon Tracker estimated that 17\% of coal-fired plants were already more expensive than new renewables and that 85\% would be by 2025.It has been suggested that no new coal plants are needed, but that existing plants could be retrofitted to operate more flexibly together with wind and solar.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{energy.png}}
\caption{Contribution of different renewables and non-renewables in indian energy market}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\par
At present day, Coal still contributes in large fraction of indian power industry. But its contribution will decrease in future as technology will evolve and as renewables will become more cheaper.

\subsection{Amount of renewables used by different indian states}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{statewise renewable.png}}
\caption{Statewise renewable energy usage}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
\par
Gujarat, Maharastra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are top states which are using renewable energy in India. Wind, Solar and Hydro energy are most common alternatives of coal to produce electricity used by Indian states.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{regionwise renewable energy.png}}
\caption{Regionwise usage of renewable energy in India}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
\par
As eastern and north-eastern Indian states have ease of availibility of coal to produce electricity, they use less renewable energy sources. 

\subsection{Sectorwise distribution in Renewable energy sector}
\par
Unlike Coal markets, the renewable energy market is uniformly distributed between public and private sectors which makes it grow more rapidly and easily than coal industry.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{sectorwise renewable energy.png}}
\caption{Sectorwise renewables in India}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effects on health and environment by coal industry}
\par 
Air pollution from coal-fired power plants is linked with asthma, cancer, heart and lung ailments, neurological problems, acid rain, global warming, and other severe environmental and public health impacts. One study found that 90\% of households surveyed in a village near a coal mine reported health problems in the last year.
\par Hence promoting renewable energy is very important for our environment and for better health of society.
